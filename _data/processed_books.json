A huge conceptual leap is required from the reader: an object can cause another object to move without even touching it. This is a difficult concept to reconcile with our everyday experiences but it makes perfect sense when we realize that is exactly how the Earth acts on us. Gravity is able to pull on us even though we are not in direct contact with the Earth. Also, the concept of super-position (and when it is applicable) is introduced. Super-position is crucial to the development of problem-solving skills so it will be illustrated in a number of example problems.

We use the principle of superposition to describe multi-particle systems as linear combinations of solutions of the general Dirac equation, and we describe the advantages of this approach over those based upon direct product wavefunctions.","reviews":"","subject":"Mathematical physics, Classical mechanics, Quantum physics (quantum mechanics & quantum field theory), SCIENCE / Physics / Mathematical & Computational, SCIENCE / Physics / General, SCIENCE / Physics / Quantum Theory, Mathematics and computation, Astronomy and astrophysics, Quantum science","series":"IOP Concise Physics","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Aug 31, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190831","page_count":null,"usd_price":null,"gbp_price":null,"format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Classical Mechanics, Volume 1","isbn":"9781643273174","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1643273175","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1643273175","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1643273175","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1643273175","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1643273175","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1643273175","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1643273175","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1643273175","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1643273175","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1643273175","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781643273174","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781643273174","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781643273174","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781643273174&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781643273174&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781643273174","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781643273174","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781643273174&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781643273174&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781643273174","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781643273174","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781643273174","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781643273174","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781643273174","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781643273174","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781643273174;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"Tools and vectors","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages-iop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3/1427//_jpg_rgb_original.jpg","author":"Gregory A DiLisi","blurb":"  <i>Classical Mechanics: Tools and vectors</i>is simply about transmitting information.

These clinical features manifest after a progressive death of many dopaminergic neurones in the brain. This book focuses on two therapies that are readily available for the patients of today. They involve the use of exercise and light (i.e. photobiomodulation: the use of red to infrared light therapy on body tissues).","reviews":"","subject":"Medical physics, Biophysics, SCIENCE / Physics / General, SCIENCE / Life Sciences / Biophysics, Medical physics and biophysics, Biomedical engineering","series":"IOP Concise Physics","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Aug 20, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190820","page_count":"172","usd_price":null,"gbp_price":null,"format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Optics","isbn":"9781643276731","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1643276735","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1643276735","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1643276735","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1643276735","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1643276735","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1643276735","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1643276735","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1643276735","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1643276735","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1643276735","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781643276731","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781643276731","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781643276731","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781643276731&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781643276731&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781643276731","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781643276731","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781643276731&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781643276731&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781643276731","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781643276731","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781643276731","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781643276731","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781643276731","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781643276731","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781643276731;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"The science of light","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages-iop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3/1384//_jpg_rgb_original.jpg","author":"Paul Ewart","blurb":"The study of light has been an important part of science from its beginning. The ancient Greeks and, prior to the Middle Ages, Islamic scholars provided important insights. With the coming of the Scientific Revolution in the 16th and 17th centuries, optics, in the shape of telescopes and microscopes, provided the means to study the universe from the very distant to the very small. Newton introduced a scientific study of the nature of light itself and today optics remains a key element of modern science, not only as an enabling technology, but in quantum optics, as a means of testing our fundamental understanding of quantum theory and the nature of reality itself.","reviews":"","subject":"Optical physics, Particle & high-energy physics, Quantum physics (quantum mechanics & quantum field theory), SCIENCE / Physics / Optics & Light, SCIENCE / Physics / Nuclear, SCIENCE / Physics / Quantum Theory, Optics and photonics, Particle and nuclear physics, Quantum science","series":"IOP Concise Physics","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Oct 30, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20191030","page_count":"118","usd_price":null,"gbp_price":null,"format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Atomic Physics","isbn":"9781643274010","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1643274015","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1643274015","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1643274015","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1643274015","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1643274015","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1643274015","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1643274015","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1643274015","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1643274015","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1643274015","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781643274010","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781643274010","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781643274010","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781643274010&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781643274010&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781643274010","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781643274010","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781643274010&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781643274010&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781643274010","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781643274010","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781643274010","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781643274010","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781643274010","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781643274010","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781643274010;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages-iop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3/1150//_jpg_rgb_original.jpg","author":"Paul Ewart","blurb":" <i>Atomic Physics</i> provides a concise treatment of atomic physics and a basis to prepare for work in other disciplines that are underpinned by atomic physics, such as chemistry, biology and several aspects of engineering science.

To understand how these qualities govern many essential biological processes, we also discuss how to measure them. However, before delving into the details and the techniques, we first learn the operational definitions in mechanics, such as force, stress, elasticity, viscosity and so on. Mechanics is explored at three different length scales  molecular, cellular, and tissue levels  sequentially, and measurement techniques to quantify the intrinsic mechanical properties are discussed, along with force generating capacity, mechanoresponsive processes in the biological systems, and rupture forces.","reviews":"","subject":"Mensuration & systems of measurement, SCIENCE / Weights & Measures, Instrumentation and measurement","series":"IOP Concise Physics","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Nov 05, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20191105","page_count":"134","usd_price":null,"gbp_price":null,"format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Classical Mechanics, Volume 3","isbn":"9781643273112","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1643273116","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1643273116","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1643273116","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1643273116","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1643273116","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1643273116","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1643273116","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1643273116","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1643273116","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1643273116","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781643273112","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781643273112","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781643273112","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781643273112&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781643273112&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781643273112","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781643273112","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781643273112&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781643273112&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781643273112","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781643273112","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781643273112","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781643273112","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781643273112","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781643273112","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781643273112;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"Newtons laws and uniform circular motion","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages-iop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3/1233//_jpg_rgb_original.jpg","author":"Gregory A DiLisi","blurb":"   <i>Classical Mechanics: Newtons laws and uniform circular motion</i>focuses on the question: Why does an object move?.

Over two years, from 1760 to 1762, Euler wrote 234 letters to two princesses on different topics including astronomy, music, optics, magnetism, electricity, motion and navigation. Today, 250 years later, we study this work of Eulers as a foundation for the history of physics teaching, and analyze the letters from a historical and pedagogical point of view. This book includes selected full and abbreviated letters and a summary of the physics content.

A survey that can be taught in a single academic term is provided, and it covers a greater variety of dynamical systems (discrete vs continuous time, finite vs infinite-dimensional, dissipative vs conservative) than are normally seen in introductory texts. Numerical computation and linear stability analysis are used as unifying themes throughout the book. Despite the emphasis on computer calculations, theory is not neglected, and fundamental concepts from the field of nonlinear dynamics, such as solution maps and invariant manifolds, are presented.","reviews":"","subject":"Mathematical physics, Classical mechanics, SCIENCE / Physics / Mathematical & Computational, SCIENCE / Physics / General, SCIENCE / Study & Teaching, Mathematics and computation","series":"IOP Concise Physics","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Apr 30, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190430","page_count":"190","usd_price":null,"gbp_price":null,"format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Keplerian Ellipses","isbn":"9781643274676","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1643274678","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1643274678","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1643274678","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1643274678","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1643274678","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1643274678","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1643274678","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1643274678","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1643274678","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1643274678","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781643274676","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781643274676","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781643274676","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781643274676&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781643274676&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781643274676","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781643274676","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781643274676&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781643274676&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781643274676","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781643274676","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781643274676","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781643274676","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781643274676","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781643274676","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781643274676;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"The physics of the gravitational two-body problem","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages-iop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3/1235//_jpg_rgb_original.jpg","author":"Bruce Cameron Reed","blurb":"The development of man's understanding of planetary motions is the crown jewel of Newtonian mechanics.

After introducing prerequisite concepts and tools, the book discusses realistic models for both time-reversal-preserving and -violating topological insulators, as well as their characteristic responses to external perturbations. These topological models are then unified and generalised by means of the tenfold topological-classification framework and the respective systematic construction of topological invariants. Given its structure, and the required background level of the reader, this book is particularly recommended for graduate students or researchers who are new to the field.

Just like light, gravity could travel through space as a wave and affect any objects it encounters by alternately compressing and expanding them. However, these waves were so difficult to detect that astronomers didnt even try for more than 50 years. Then, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, two events occurred that started the hunt for gravity waves in earnest. Though the first was ultimately proved wrong, this result started scientists thinking about what instrumentation might be necessary to detect these waves. It took another 40 years of development of successively more sensitive detectors before the first real direct effects were observed in 2015, 100 years after gravitational waves were first predicted. \n        This is the story of that hunt, and the insight it is producing into an array of topics in modern science, from the creation of the chemical elements to understanding of the properties of gravity itself.\n      ","reviews":"","subject":"Astrophysics, Mensuration & systems of measurement, Classical mechanics, SCIENCE / Physics / Astrophysics, SCIENCE / Physics / General, SCIENCE / Weights & Measures, Astronomy and astrophysics","series":"IOP Concise Physics","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Apr 10, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190410","page_count":"52","usd_price":null,"gbp_price":null,"format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Can Physics Save Miami (and Shanghai and Venice, by Lowering the Sea)?","isbn":"9781643274256","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1643274252","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1643274252","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1643274252","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1643274252","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1643274252","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1643274252","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1643274252","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1643274252","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1643274252","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1643274252","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781643274256","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781643274256","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781643274256","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781643274256&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781643274256&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781643274256","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781643274256","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781643274256&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781643274256&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781643274256","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781643274256","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781643274256","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781643274256","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781643274256","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781643274256","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781643274256;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages-iop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3/1214//_jpg_rgb_original.jpg","author":"Edward Wolf","blurb":"Credible predictions for sea-level rise by the year 2100 range from 12 inches to above six feet.

Both analytical theories and numerical schemes are also provided, and the current research developments in this field as well as the future prospects are discussed.","reviews":"","subject":"Plasma physics, Electricity, electromagnetism & magnetism, Particle & high-energy physics, SCIENCE / Physics / General, SCIENCE / Physics / Electromagnetism, SCIENCE / Energy, Plasmas","series":"IOP Concise Physics","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Feb 06, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190206","page_count":"154","usd_price":null,"gbp_price":null,"format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Special and General Relativity","isbn":"9781643273778","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1643273779","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1643273779","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1643273779","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1643273779","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1643273779","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1643273779","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1643273779","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1643273779","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1643273779","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1643273779","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781643273778","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781643273778","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781643273778","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781643273778&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781643273778&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781643273778","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781643273778","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781643273778&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781643273778&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781643273778","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781643273778","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781643273778","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781643273778","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781643273778","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781643273778","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781643273778;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"An introduction to spacetime and gravitation","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages-iop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3/1237//_jpg_rgb_original.jpg","author":"Rainer Dick","blurb":"This book provides a concise introduction to the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity. The format has been chosen to provide the basis for a single semester course that can take the students all the way from the foundations of special relativity to the core results of general relativity: the Einstein equation, and the equations of motion for particles and light in curved spacetime. To facilitate access to the topics of special and general relativity for science and engineering students, without prior training in relativity or geometry, the relevant geometric notions are also introduced.","reviews":"","subject":"Astrophysics, SCIENCE / Physics / Astrophysics, Astronomy and astrophysics","series":"IOP Concise Physics","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Feb 07, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190207","page_count":"152","usd_price":null,"gbp_price":null,"format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Science in the Arena","isbn":"9781643271774","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1643271776","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1643271776","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1643271776","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1643271776","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1643271776","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1643271776","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1643271776","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1643271776","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1643271776","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1643271776","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781643271774","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781643271774","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781643271774","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781643271774&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781643271774&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781643271774","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781643271774","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781643271774&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781643271774&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781643271774","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781643271774","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781643271774","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781643271774","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781643271774","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781643271774","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781643271774;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"Explanations and analyses of performances and phenomena in sport","image_path":"https://bibliocloudimages-iop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/3/903//_jpg_rgb_original.jpg","author":"Blane Baker","blurb":" The arena of sport is filled with marvelous performances and feats that, at times, seem almost beyond belief. As curious onlookers, we often wonder whether or not athletes will reach certain peaks and what determines their limits of athletic performance. Science, with its emphasis on theoretical development and experimental results, is uniquely equipped to answer these kinds of questions.<i>Science in the Arena</i>provides useful and understandable scientific explanations of athletic performance.
